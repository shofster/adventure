Adventure is based ont the 1975 Colossal Cave Adventure game written by Will Crowther.
The initial version was written in FORTRAN for a DEC-PDP10 (without strings!).

This version (translated to GO - version 1.18 or later) makes use of the cross platform graphical package (version 2.2.2) found at https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne.
